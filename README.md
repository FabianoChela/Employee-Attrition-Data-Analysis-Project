# Employee-Attrition-Data-Analysis-Project
Project Scope
Employee attrition occurs when employees leave an organisation for unpredictable or uncontrollable reasons. Many terms make up attrition, the most common being termination, resignation, planned retirement, structural changes, long-term illness, or layoffs. It often results in a decrease in an organisationâ€™s workforce size as employees leave faster than the rate at which their employers hire. Solving the attrition problem within an organisation requires business and human resource leaders to use big-picture, strategic thinking and interventions. (Lucas, S. 2023)

As a data analyst, the main goal of this project was to answer analytical questions about the employee attrition dataset to derive valuable insights and trends. The following analytical questions were the focus of this project.

Are certain departments experiencing higher levels of attrition than others? If so, why might that be?
What is the average tenure of employees who leave the company, and how does it compare to employees who stay long-term?
How does attrition vary based on demographics (e.g., age, gender, education level, etc.)?
What are the key indicators or drivers of employee attrition? (e.g. job satisfaction, average monthly hours, salary, promotions, job title, etc.)

Project Approach
The employee attrition dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle. The data preparation, cleaning, and exploratory analysis were done using Python. The Python IDE which was used for this project is Spyder. Finally, the dashboard visualisations for the data were created using Tableau.
